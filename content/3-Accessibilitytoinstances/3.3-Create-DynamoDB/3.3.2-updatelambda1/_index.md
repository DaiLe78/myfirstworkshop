### Add more IAM Roles for Lambda1
2. Go to [IAM service management console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home).
  + Click on **Roles**.
  + Select **Lambda1 role**.
  + Add these roles: **AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess**, **ec2:CreateNetworkInterface**, **ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces**, **ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface**.

{{%notice tip%}}
These **ec2 permissions** ensure that Lambda can automatically create, use, and delete Network Interfaces when running within a VPC. They enable Lambda to connect to VPC resources, maintain performance, and manage network resources efficiently.
